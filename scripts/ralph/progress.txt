# Hydration mismatch fix completed for theme/lang client preferences and browser-injected attributes.
# Files: app/layout.tsx, public/hydration-sanitize.js, lib/context/ThemeContext.tsx, lib/context/LangContext.tsx, lib/hooks/useMounted.ts, components/landing/Nav.tsx, components/layout/TopBar.tsx, components/layout/SearchDialog.tsx, tasks/lessons.md
